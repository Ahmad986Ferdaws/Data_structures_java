// first  we look at the definition of the static array:

// static array is fixed array, once we have declared it we cannot change the capacity of it
// on the other hand dynamic arrays

public class dynamic_arrays {
public static void main(String[] args) {


ArrayList<String> aray = new ArrayList<>();

aaaaaa

    }
}



// Static Arraysss
// Definition: Fixed-size arrays where the size is 
// determined at the time of creation and cannot be changed during runtime.
// Characteristics:
// Allocated in contiguous memory.
// Fast access due to fixed size.

// Inefficient if size needs change (can waste or lack space).
// Real-World Scenario:

// Classroom Attendance: A teacher knows the class has exactly 30 students. They create a list (array) of size 30 to record
// attendance. If more students join, the list cannot grow.

// Dynamic Arrays
// Definition: Arrays that can resize (grow or shrink) during runtime
// as mush as we would like to update it on time
// , often implemented using data structures like vectors or ArrayLists.
// Characteristics:
// Efficient memory usage.aaaaaa
// Allows addition/removal of elements dynamically.
// May involve overhead (e.g., copying data when resizing).
// Real-World Scenario:
// Playlist on Music App: A user starts with a playlist of 10 songs but 
    // keeps adding new tracks. The playlist (dynamic array) grows as needed.
