// first  we look at the definition of the static array:

// static array is fixed array, once we have declared it we cannot change the capacity of it
// on the other hand dynamic arrays

// Static Arrays
// Definition: Fixed-size arrays where the size is determined at the time of creation and cannot be changed during runtime.
// Characteristics:
// Allocated in contiguous memory.
// Fast access due to fixed size.
